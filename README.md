# Basic_Cpp_Projects

This repository contains C++ programs I am writing while learning the language.
It reflects my hands-on practice, experimentation, mistakes, fixes, and gradual improvement over time.

I am creating this repo to strengthen my fundamentals, build logic, and get comfortable thinking in C++.
Each program represents a small step forward in understanding how things work under the hood.

Why this repository exists:
-> To practice consistently while learning C++
-> To track my progress over time
-> To revisit concepts and improve older code
-> To build a solid foundation before moving to advanced topics

Notes:
-> Code may evolve as I continue learning
-> Simplicity is intentional
-> Feedback and suggestions are most welcome
-> There definitely exist better alternatives to my code
